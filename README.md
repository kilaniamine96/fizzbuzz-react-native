# React Native FizzBuzz & Reverse String â€” Feature-Based Clean Architecture

A minimal **React Native** template showcasing **Feature-Based Design (FBD)** with a strict **Clean Architecture** separation (domain / data / presentation) using **Redux Toolkit** and **Redux Thunks**.  
Two example features are included:

- **FizzBuzz**
- **Reverse String**

This project serves as a model for scalable, maintainable applications or as a reference for interviews and code reviews.

---

## Why this template?

- **Feature-based structure**: each feature is self-contained.
- **Clean Architecture**: business logic isolated from framework code.
- **Redux Toolkit + Thunks** for predictable state management and async logic.
- **Test-friendly**: domain and data layers are pure and decoupled.
- **Easy to extend**: adding features follows a consistent pattern.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native** (TypeScript)
- **Redux Toolkit** (slices, immutable state updates)
- **Redux Thunk** (async orchestration)
- **Jest** + **@testing-library/react-native** (testing)
